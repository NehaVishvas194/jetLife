                        <p>Our Website is a travel search engine. JETLIFE does not provide, own or control any of the
                            travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights,
                            accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the "Travel Products"). The
                            Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the "Travel
                            Providers") either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel agency). The
                            Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products. The Travel Provider's terms and
                            privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to and understand those terms.
                            Furthermore, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.)
                            apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction
                            with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk; JETLIFE does not
                            bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.
                        </p>

                        <p>The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does not-in any way-imply,
                            suggest, or constitute a recommendation by JETLIFE of that Travel Product or Travel
                            Provider,
                            or any sponsorship or approval of JETLIFE by such Travel Provider, or any affiliation
                            between
                            such Travel Provider and JETLIFE.
                        </p>

                        <p>JETLIFE hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers.
                            JETLIFE is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such
                            content.
                            Since JETLIFE has no control over the Travel Products and does not verify the content
                            uploaded
                            by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our
                            Website. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services
                            charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always
                            check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. More details here. Some
                            Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you
                            for the display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for informational purposes
                            only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real-time; actual rates may vary, and your
                            payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply
                            another date's currency rate.

                        <h5>2. Booking through JETLIFE</h5>
                        <p>If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the
                            Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface.
                            Accordingly, JETLIFE has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because
                            JETLIFE
                            has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price
                            and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or
                            disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these
                            with the Travel Provider and not with us.
